Things wanting to Add:

I noted that on the delete page for shoes, users were not able to be "warned" whether or not they were wanting to delete the shoe. Giving them a 2nd chance or confirmation, and not a mistake. 

Image upload and even upload from mobile device <--- Investigated but was a little ttricky.



Issues:

Hiding variables / content from users before logging in. I found this beyond timely trying to hide content behind a login form.

Usernames and password issues with siteground.

Siteground displaying differently to my localhost setup.

Wanting to customise each page to suit the theme. Your COllection = lokerroom full of shoes.... Delete SHoes = Shoes on fire (Background images)

wanting information to overlay a background image in the future.
