Things wanting to Add:

I noted that on the delete page for shoes, users were not able to be "warned" whether or not they were wanting to delete the shoe. Giving them a 2nd chance or confirmation, and not a mistake. 


Issues:

Hiding variables / content from users before logging in. I found this beyond timely trying to hide content behind a login form.
